## MOS Technologies, Inc. 6502 Emulator

The 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor, originally introduced in 1975.
This project is an emulator of the 6502 microprocessor, written in C++,
using CMake, Ninja, Conan, GoogleTest, and Doxygen.

### Motivation

Although the 6502 is a relatively simple architecture and courses such as Computer
Architecture and Operating Systems have given me practical experience working at
much higher complexities, the motivation for this project was to become familiar with
the tooling (build, package management, testing, and documentation) of a
modern C++ project.
